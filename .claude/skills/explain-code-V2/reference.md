# Python Quick Reference for Explanations

Load this file when explaining Python-specific code.

## Common beginner concepts to address

### Variables
- Think of them as labeled boxes that hold a value
- `x = 5` means "put the number 5 in a box called x"

### Functions
- Defined with `def`, called by name with `()`
- `return` sends a value back to whoever called the function
- Parameters are the inputs listed in the parentheses

### Lists
- Ordered collection: `[1, 2, 3]`
- Zero-indexed — the first item is at position 0
- Mutable: you can change items after creating the list

### Dictionaries
- Key-value pairs: `{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}`
- Like a real dictionary — look up a value by its key

### Loops
- `for` loop: runs once for each item in a sequence
- `while` loop: keeps running as long as a condition is True

### If / elif / else
- Decision-making: "if this is true, do X; otherwise do Y"

## Common gotchas to mention
- `=` is assignment, `==` is comparison
- Indentation matters — it defines code blocks
- Lists are mutable, strings and tuples are not
- `None` is not the same as `0` or `False`
- Integer division with `/` returns a float; use `//` for whole numbers
